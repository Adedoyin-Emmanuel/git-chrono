`Git-Chrono` is a simple CLI tool that makes your **Github-Contribution-Graph** look like a pro. 🚀
I built this tool to expand my knowledge of the `C programming language`.

## How does it work 🤔

Although `Git-Chrono` was built in C, the logic behind it is generating false commits and seeding the commits throughout the year. Basically, you pass the total commits you want for a day, and the saturation. With this, it would generate commits for that git-repo throughout the year.

With this tool, I can seed my Contribution-Graph with commits throughout the year.

As you can see it looks beautiful. Please use at your own risk 🫵

## Usage ⚙️

To use the `Git-Chrono` download the executable file and run the executable file with the necessary parameters.
the executable file is the main which is part of the repo

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Adedoyin-Emmanuel/git-chrono
cd git-chrono
./main --saturation 70 --max-commit 10

```

To get all possible arguments to use with the `Git-Chrono` type
